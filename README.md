**Goal**: design a mobile grocery ordering and delivery application for a fictitious grocery store, Good Market.

**Problem**: Good Market market share has decreased by 8% each year. Market and user research determined the decline is most likely due to the increase in competitors' online grocery ordering and delivery products.
